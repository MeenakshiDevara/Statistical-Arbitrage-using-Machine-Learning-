# Statistical-Arbitrage-using-Machine-Learning-
Problem Statement:
In the context of a family of stocks within the same sector or industry, a consistent correlation typically exists among their prices. 
However, anomalies occur during brief periods when this correlation is disrupted. Remarkably, the market tends to self-correct over time, restoring the correlation.

Objective:
To address this challenge, I developed a machine learning algorithm designed to predict statistical arbitrage opportunities within the NSE (National Stock Exchange) based on historical data from 2016. 
The algorithm identifies instances when the established correlation breaks down, signaling potential arbitrage opportunities. 
This model will be rigorously tested using 2017 data to evaluate its accuracy and effectiveness in capturing and exploiting market anomalies. 
The ultimate goal is to provide actionable insights for traders or investors seeking to capitalize on these temporary disruptions in correlated stock prices.

Thanks!
